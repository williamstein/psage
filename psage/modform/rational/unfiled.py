Miscellaneous code related to rational modular forms, until I find a

another module at some point, probably.

    """
    Find the modular symbols spaces that should correspond to the
    Jacobian of the given hyperelliptic curve, up to the number of
    factors we consider.

    INPUT:
        - C -- a hyperelliptic curve over QQ
        - N -- a positive integer
        - num_factors -- number of Euler factors to verify match up; this is
          important, because if, e.g., there is only one factor of degree g(C), we
          don't want to just immediately conclude that Jac(C) = A_f. 
        
    OUTPUT:
        - list of all sign 1 simple modular symbols factor of level N
          that correspond to a simple modular abelian A_f
          that is isogenous to Jac(C).
